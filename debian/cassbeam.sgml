    <para>This manual page was written for the &debian; distribution

     </para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is a program for Cassegrain antenna modelling.
     Based on an input text file, it computes several properties of the antenna including 
     gain, zenith system temperature, and the beam, in full polarization.  All calculations
     are done in the transmit sense and use reciprocity to relate to the equivalent receiving 
     system.  See the documentation file cassbeam.tex in /usr/share/doc/cassbeam/ for more
     information.
