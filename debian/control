Description:  Cassegrain antenna modelling
 Cassbeam is a Cassegrain antenna ray tracer. A Cassegrain antenna is a double reflector system which works
 on the principle of cassegrain optical telescope. A high gain cassegrain reflector antenna in Ku-band
 has been successfully developed for command transmit application for the missile programme. It can also be
 used for monopulse radar, satellite communication. 
 .
 Based on an input text file, it computes several properties of the antenna including gain, zenith system
 temperature, and the beam, in full polarization. All calculations are done in the transmit sense and use
 reciprocity to relate to the equivalent receiving system.
 .
 Additionally, cassbeam allows deformations, or pathologies of the optics to be modelled. Currently this
 is limited to rotations and translations of the feed and secondary. In the future, large scale deviations
 in the primary (such as a misplaced panel) will likely be supported.
