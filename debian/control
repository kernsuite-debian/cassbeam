Description: a Cassegrain antenna ray tracer
 Based on an input text file, it computes several properties of the antenna
 including gain, zenith system temperature, and the beam, in full polarization.
 All calculations are done in the {\it transmit sense} and use reciprocity to
 relate to the equivalent receiving system.
