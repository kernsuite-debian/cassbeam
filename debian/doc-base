Title:Software for Cassegrain antenna modelling
Author: Walter Brisken
Abstract: Cassbeam is a Cassegrain antenna ray tracer.  Based on an input text
 file, it computes several properties of the antenna including gain,
 zenith system temperature, and the beam, in full polarization.  All calculations
 are done in the transmit sense and use reciprocity to relate to the
 equivalent receiving system.
